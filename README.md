# O3DE Generative AI Gems collection

This repository contains the implementation of O3DE Gems, as outlined in the [Request for Comments (RFC)](https://github.com/o3de/sig-simulation/issues/87). 

The implementation has reached a state of near-finality, with the codebase now considered substantially complete and stable. All necessary testing and validation have been conducted, and the remaining tasks are focused on refining and polishing the code for its impending release. The current codebase can be found on the **development** branch. 

The repository is open to contributions through testing, pull requests and code reviews.
